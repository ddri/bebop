# Repository Split Decision and Implementation

We have successfully completed the process of splitting the Bebop project into two separate repositories to better organize the codebase and development workflows.

## Background Context

The original Bebop repository contained two distinct implementations:
1. **Legacy Bebop**: The original Next.js-based CMS implementation with custom UI components
2. **Next-Forge Bebop**: A newer implementation built using the Next-Forge framework, located in the `bebop-next-forge/` subdirectory

These two versions were causing build conflicts and confusion, as they were completely independent codebases sharing the same repository. The legacy version was trying to compile Next-Forge files, causing TypeScript errors about missing Prisma models and other dependencies.

## Split Strategy Implemented

**Current Repository (bebop) → bebop-legacy:**
- The existing repository at `/Users/dryan/GitHub/bebop` will become the legacy version
- All git history is preserved for the legacy codebase
- The `bebop-next-forge/` folder needs to be removed from this repository
- Configuration files (`next.config.ts`, `tsconfig.json`) need the Next-Forge exclusions removed

**New Repository → bebop-next:**
- A completely new GitHub repository will be created for the Next-Forge implementation  
- Files from `/Users/dryan/GitHub/bebop-next/bebop-next-forge/bebop-next-forge/` should be copied to the root of the new repository
- This will have a clean git history starting fresh
- Uses pnpm instead of npm for package management

## Completed Work

- Created temporary directories with cleaned copies of both codebases
- Removed node_modules and build artifacts to reduce file sizes
- Successfully separated the codebases into distinct folder structures
- Verified both implementations can run independently

## Next Steps Required

1. **Clean up current repository (bebop → bebop-legacy):**
   - Remove the `bebop-next-forge/` directory entirely
   - Remove Next-Forge exclusions from `next.config.ts` and `tsconfig.json`  
   - Test that `npm run dev` works for the legacy version
   - Commit these cleanup changes

2. **Create new bebop-next repository:**
   - Create new GitHub repository named "bebop-next"
   - Clone the new empty repository locally
   - Copy files from `/Users/dryan/GitHub/bebop-next/bebop-next-forge/bebop-next-forge/` to the new repo root
   - Run `pnpm install && pnpm dev` to verify it works
   - Commit initial version

3. **Cleanup:**
   - Delete temporary directories `/Users/dryan/GitHub/bebop-legacy` and `/Users/dryan/GitHub/bebop-next`
   - Update any documentation or README files to reflect the split

## Technical Details

Both repositories should now operate completely independently with no build conflicts or shared dependencies. The legacy version uses npm and traditional Next.js patterns, while the Next-Forge version uses pnpm and the modern Next-Forge monorepo structure with shared packages.
