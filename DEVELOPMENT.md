# Bebop Development Roadmap

## Project Overview
Bebop is a content management system designed for technical content creators and Developer Relations professionals. It provides a unified writing and publishing workflow that eliminates the pain of managing content across multiple platforms.

**Current Status**: v0.2.0  
**Tech Stack**: Next.js 15, TypeScript, MongoDB Atlas, Clerk Auth, Vercel deployment

## Priority & Labeling System

### Issue Types
- `type: bug` - Something broken or not working as expected
- `type: enhancement` - Improve existing feature or functionality
- `type: feature` - New functionality or capability
- `type: tech-debt` - Code quality, maintenance, or refactoring

### Priority Levels
- `priority: critical` - Blocking functionality, security issues, or major bugs
- `priority: high` - Important for user experience or core workflows
- `priority: medium` - Worthwhile improvements that enhance the product
- `priority: low` - Nice-to-have features or minor improvements

### Effort Estimation
- `effort: small` - 1-2 hours of work
- `effort: medium` - Half day of focused work
- `effort: large` - Multiple days or complex implementation

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Technical Foundation (Current)
**Goal**: Establish a solid, maintainable codebase

**Recent Progress**:
- ✅ Package updates & security vulnerability fixes
- ✅ Critical linting errors resolved (React Hooks, text escaping)
- ✅ Empty interface cleanup

**Current Tasks**:
- [ ] Fix remaining TypeScript `any` types (~30 instances)
- [ ] Clean up unused imports and variables
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling and boundaries
- [ ] Implement consistent loading states
- [ ] Database connection resilience

### Phase 2: User Experience Audit
**Goal**: Identify and fix pain points in core user workflows

**Planned Tasks**:
- [ ] Test complete user journey: write → organize → publish
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness review
- [ ] Performance optimization audit
- [ ] Accessibility improvements
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts for power users

### Phase 3: Feature Enhancement
**Goal**: Expand capabilities based on user needs

**Potential Features**:
- [ ] Content versioning and history
- [ ] Enhanced media management
- [ ] Publishing analytics and metrics
- [ ] Content templates and snippets
- [ ] Advanced markdown features
- [ ] Collaborative editing features

### Phase 4: Polish & Optimization
**Goal**: Refine the user experience and optimize performance

**Planned Tasks**:
- [ ] UI/UX polish and consistency
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Advanced publishing options
- [ ] Integration with additional platforms
- [ ] Advanced campaign management

## Key Areas of Focus

### Technical Debt Priority
1. **TypeScript Coverage** - Eliminate `any` types for better type safety
2. **Error Handling** - Comprehensive error boundaries and user feedback
3. **Code Quality** - Consistent patterns and best practices
4. **Performance** - Optimize bundle size and runtime performance

### User Experience Priority
1. **Writing Experience** - Smooth, distraction-free content creation
2. **Publishing Flow** - Intuitive multi-platform publishing
3. **Content Organization** - Efficient topic and collection management
4. **Feedback Systems** - Clear status indicators and error messages

### Feature Expansion Priority
1. **Content Management** - Version control, templates, advanced organization
2. **Analytics** - Publishing metrics and campaign performance
3. **Platform Integration** - Additional publishing destinations
4. **Collaboration** - Team features and workflow improvements

## Working Session Structure

### Recommended Approach
1. **Status Check** (5 min) - Review current state and any blockers
2. **Focus Selection** (5 min) - Pick 1-3 related issues to tackle
3. **Implementation** (30-90 min) - Code, test, and iterate
4. **Review & Commit** (10 min) - Test, document, and commit changes
5. **Next Steps** (5 min) - Plan next session priorities

### Best Practices
- **Small, focused commits** with clear messages
- **Test before committing** - ensure builds pass
- **Document decisions** - update this roadmap as needed
- **Stay focused** - avoid context switching between unrelated areas

## Current Technical Debt Summary

### High Priority Issues
- **TypeScript any types**: ~30 instances across hooks, API middleware, and social clients
- **Missing error boundaries**: Components lack proper error handling
- **Inconsistent loading states**: Some operations don't provide user feedback
- **Unused imports**: ~70 unused import statements (warnings)

### Medium Priority Issues
- **useEffect dependencies**: Missing dependencies in Collections.tsx
- **Performance optimization**: Bundle size and runtime optimizations
- **Mobile responsiveness**: Ensure all features work on mobile devices
- **Accessibility**: Add proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation

## Next Session Priorities

1. **Technical Foundation**: Continue with TypeScript cleanup
2. **User Experience**: Test core workflows and identify pain points
3. **Feature Planning**: Prioritize based on user feedback and vision
