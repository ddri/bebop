npm run test:quick

# All smoke tests with detailed output
npm run test:smoke

# Live API testing (requires dev server)
npm run test:workflow

# Interactive test UI
npm run test:ui

# Watch mode during development
npm test
```

### What's Tested

**Publishing Workflow:**
- ✅ Three scheduling modes: "Publish Now", "Add to Queue", "Custom Schedule"
- ✅ Date/time validation and timezone handling
- ✅ Publishing plan creation and status transitions
- ✅ Background scheduler processing

**API Endpoints:**
- ✅ `POST /api/publishing-plans` - Create scheduled publications
- ✅ `POST /api/publishing-plans/process-scheduled` - Process due publications
- ✅ `POST /api/scheduler/trigger` - Manual scheduler trigger

**Components:**
- ✅ HybridPublisher form validation and submission
- ✅ Platform selection and content requirements
- ✅ Lazy loading states and performance optimizations

### Manual Testing Checklist

1. **Start Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test Scheduling Features**
   - Visit `/campaigns/[id]` (create campaign if needed)
   - Test "Publish Now" - immediate publishing
   - Test "Add to Queue" - 1-hour delay scheduling  
   - Test "Custom Schedule" - user-selected date/time
   - Use "Process Now" button in campaign planner

3. **Test Performance Optimizations**
   - Visit `/write`, `/media`, `/settings`
   - Verify lazy loading with skeleton states
   - Run `npm run build:analyze` for bundle analysis

4. **Test API Integration**
   ```bash
   # Test scheduler manually
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/scheduler/trigger
   
   # Check database health
   curl http://localhost:3000/api/health/database
   ```
