## Priority & Labeling System

### Issue Types
- `type: bug` - Something broken or not working as expected
- `type: enhancement` - Improve existing feature or functionality
- `type: feature` - New functionality or capability

---------

## Development Phases

The roadmap is roughly organised by the release cycle, which is based on my personal bias and general intentions. There is no special versioning system, just what I feel is sensible at the time.

### ✅ Completed in version 0.3.5

- **Security and code quality audit**
    - ✅ Package updates & security vulnerability fixes
    - ✅ Critical linting errors resolved (React Hooks, text escaping)
    - ✅ Empty interface cleanup
    - ✅ Fix remaining TypeScript `any` types (97% improvement - only 3 instances remain)
    - ✅ Clean up unused imports and variables
    - ✅ Add comprehensive error handling and boundaries
    - ✅ Implement consistent loading states
    - ✅ Database connection resilience with retry logic
    - ✅ Robust ErrorBoundary system with specialized variants (ApiErrorBoundary, EditorErrorBoundary)
    - ✅ Database error categorization with user-friendly messaging
    
- **Major feature addition**
    - ✅ Comprehensive search functionality across topics and collections
    - ✅ Real-time search with keyboard shortcuts (Cmd+K)
    - ✅ MongoDB text indexing for efficient search
    - ✅ Smart result highlighting and relevance scoring

### ✅ Completed in version 0.4.0 - Code Quality & Publishing Workflow (**Updated based on implementation**)

**Code quality improvements:**
- ✅ **TypeScript cleanup**: Fixed remaining `any` types with proper component interfaces
- ✅ **Publishing workflow**: Complete scheduling system with three modes (now, queue, custom)

# General guidance for how we work on Bebop

## Working Session Structure

### Recommended Approach
1. **Status Check** (5 min) - Review current state and any blockers
2. **Focus Selection** (5 min) - Pick 1-3 related issues to tackle
3. **Implementation** (30-90 min) - Code, test, and iterate
4. **Review & Commit** (10 min) - Test, document, and commit changes
5. **Next Steps** (5 min) - Plan next session priorities

### Best Practices
- **Small, focused commits** with clear messages (and do NOT reference AI tools)
- **Test before committing** - ensure builds pass quality testing
- **Document decisions** - update this roadmap as needed
- **Stay focused** - avoid context switching between unrelated areas
