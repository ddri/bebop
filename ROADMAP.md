---------

## Development Phases

The roadmap is roughly organised by the release cycle, which is based on my personal bias and general intentions. There is no special versioning system, just what I feel is sensible at the time.

### ✅ Completed in version 0.3.5

- **Security and code quality audit**
    - ✅ Package updates & security vulnerability fixes
    - ✅ Critical linting errors resolved (React Hooks, text escaping)
    - ✅ Empty interface cleanup
    - ✅ Fix remaining TypeScript `any` types (97% improvement - only 3 instances remain)
    - ✅ Clean up unused imports and variables
    - ✅ Add comprehensive error handling and boundaries
    - ✅ Implement consistent loading states
    - ✅ Database connection resilience with retry logic
    - ✅ Robust ErrorBoundary system with specialized variants (ApiErrorBoundary, EditorErrorBoundary)
    - ✅ Database error categorization with user-friendly messaging
    
- **Major feature addition**
    - ✅ Comprehensive search functionality across topics and collections
    - ✅ Real-time search with keyboard shortcuts (Cmd+K)
    - ✅ MongoDB text indexing for efficient search
    - ✅ Smart result highlighting and relevance scoring

    - ✅ **Campaign Export/Import** - Complete JSON/CSV export with privacy options and conflict resolution on import
    - ✅ **Bulk Scheduling Modal** - Immediate, specific, and staggered scheduling options
    - ✅ **Bulk Platform Assignment** - Visual platform selector with replace/add/remove modes

- **Analytics & Insights**
    - ✅ **Campaign Analytics Dashboard** - Comprehensive metrics with time range filtering
    - ✅ **Performance Charts** - Bar charts for views, engagement, and shares over time
    - ✅ **Platform Breakdown** - Donut chart and detailed platform-specific metrics
    - ✅ **Goals Progress Tracking** - Visual progress bars with status indicators

# General guidance for how we work on Bebop

## Working Session Structure

### Recommended Approach
1. **Status Check** (5 min) - Review current state and any blockers
2. **Focus Selection** (5 min) - Pick 1-3 related issues to tackle
3. **Implementation** (30-90 min) - Code, test, and iterate
4. **Review & Commit** (10 min) - Test, document, and commit changes
5. **Next Steps** (5 min) - Plan next session priorities

### Best Practices
- **Small, focused commits** with clear messages (and do NOT reference AI tools)
- **Test before committing** - ensure builds pass quality testing
- **Document decisions** - update this roadmap as needed
- **Stay focused** - avoid context switching between unrelated areas
